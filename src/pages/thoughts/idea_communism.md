Here is one of my secrets: I shamelessly steal ideas from people that I talk to. I leave comments on internet articles and videos, the best I can come up with, and then see how people reply. Many of my ideas come from people who critiqued me, or people who agreed with me but added their own additional insight.

Here is the deal I offer anyone who converses with me. If you like what I say, feel free to shamelessly steal it. No need to cite me, unless you want to. I don't care if I get credit. I just want there to be more good ideas. I am an idea communist. Not "my" ideas. "Our" ideas. But, you know, you are going to Hell if you don't cite me. Don't worry - we'll all have fun down there with all the interesting people.
