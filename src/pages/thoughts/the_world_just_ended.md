title: The World Just Ended, and I'm Still Alive
pubDate: 2023-01-16

A few times, I've gotten this weird feeling that the world just ended, but somehow, it didn't end. You know how at any moment the Earth could get hit by a meteor, or some strange cosmic event could occur which shreds it into a cloud of space dust. I imagine something like that happening, but then I get the feeling that it really did happen, but somehow un-happened, like a time traveler came back and undid it, and I was caught in the moment in between. The feeling isn't really intense, it's more just "spooky". And it also makes me laugh at myself because of how absurd it is. I suppose it's just one of those briefly psychotic moments where I mistake my imagination for reality, a kind of waking baby nightmare. That happens to me frequently - I'm overcome by my imagination, I take it really seriously for a moment or two, and then I catch myself and laugh about my innate propensity to fall for my own bullshit. It certainly makes life more entertaining, though.
