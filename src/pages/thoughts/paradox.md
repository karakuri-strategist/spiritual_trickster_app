The only way to create a religion or ideology which will satisfy most people is to include many subtle paradoxes which let people interpret it however they want at the time. And then when they have a change of perspective they can say, "Ah! I am still an 'insert-belief-here', but now I understand the true meaning!" In other words, you don't give people something they can all agree on, you give them something they can all disagree on.
