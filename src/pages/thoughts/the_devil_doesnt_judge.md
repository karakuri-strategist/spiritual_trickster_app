title: The Devil Doesn't Judge
---

There is one redeeming quality of the devil which we should all seek to emulate: the devil doesn't judge. He comes to anyone, anywhere, and offers them exactly what they want (at a terrible price). He doesn't look at this or that person in disgust, find their hopes and dreams trivial or stupid, he isn't picky out of a kind of profane righteousness. 

No, he will come to a mother whose son is dying, and offer to save him from death (in exchange for eternal servitude, or something like that). He will come to a guy who wants to learn to play the guitar. And yes, he will also come to people with twisted fantasies of vengeance and domination. He comes to anyone who craves anything.

It is not your moral obligation to judge. Nor is it your moral obligation to feel shame, whether it is performed or simply held internally. Your only obligation is to do what you feel is right. People only do just what they feel. All judgment does is keep you from allowing yourself to understand, to traverse the web of a complex social fabric full of emotional texture. And understanding is always ultimately in your best interest, no matter how uncomfortable the truths you find are. Withhold your judgment - perception is temporary, it changes when new facts come along. You never know what will be cast in a new light.
