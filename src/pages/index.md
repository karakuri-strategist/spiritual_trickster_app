Hello, welcome to my website, Spiritual Trickster. This is my space to share my poetry, thoughts, ramblings, essays, and generally speaking, be an exhibitionist on the internet. Here my soul wears a fig leaf, I am trying to show you as much as I feel comfortable with. Actually, more than I feel comfortable with. My goal is to use this place to progressively become as shameless as possible. There is a big difference between giving no fucks and giving a few. It’s like an inverse function. To optimize it, you want to get as close to zero as possible, without becoming undefined. Like, you want to give 0.0000000000000000000000000..1 fucks. If you give even one whole fuck, then you only get one on the Y-axis, and it only goes down from there, rapidly approaching 0. One of what, you ask? I don’t know. I’m not really sure what it is I’m optimizing for. I just know I want that number to be BIG.

But why? Why would I do that? I’ve dealt with anxiety, shame, and depression for a while now. I’ve always been a bit of a sensitive people pleaser. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar, and had my first, and hopefully last psychotic, manic episode. (It was fantastic. And retroactively horrifying.) Here’s the thing - a lot of dark shit goes through my mind. And I mean a lot. It’s a spiral - you get more repressed, you become more discontent, angry and resentful, you see those ugly emotions in yourself, and then you feel even more ashamed of yourself. And you start entertaining insane, desperate ideas (at least, that’s the case for me). What is the nature of reality? Is there an afterlife? Is there a loving God, or an overarching principle of the universe which makes everything okay in the end? All questions quite pertinent to someone feeling suicidal.

There is a kind of gushing, poetic, spiritual, realer-than-real creative impulse that comes with this that plays on all our deepest fears, hopes and desires. I pursue this intense beauty, the kind that overwhelms you, disarms you. I write my poetry, articulate my ideas, some people like them… And privately, they sit next to all the worst thoughts I’ve ever had in my life. I become more and more desperate to prove to myself that I’m beautiful inside, as my mind becomes more and more of a nightmare. Well, no more. I want to show you the worst parts, what I feel ashamed of, embarrassed of. Not only the worst parts - I’ll share whatever I want here. But those are most important to share, to me. Maybe people will think less of me. Maybe they’ll think more? I care, but I want not to.

Some of my interests have been formed in this period of my life, and I’d like to disentangle them from my insecurity and desperation. Maybe I really will uncover the nature of reality? (No, I won’t. But I’ll have fun trying!) Maybe I’ll even hit you deep with something from my bag of cheap tricks. I’m sorry. That’s cruel of me, both to you and to myself - it’s okay, to feel. But what comes after all this intensity? Beauty can help us cope with life, help us survive - but survive so that we can do what? Experience more and more beauty of every greater potency, in an oversexed maelstrom of sentimentality? Pleasure can become pain. It can cloud our vision, and make us ignorant of ourselves.

I don’t want to be ashamed of anything, and that includes being ashamed of being ashamed, resenting myself for not being strong enough to let it all out, regardless of what anyone will think of me. So, here we go. It’s time to press the big red button. Whatever happens, happens.
