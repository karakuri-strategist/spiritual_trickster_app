<pre>
I see the hope in your eyes
For your destination.
I see belief in your eyes
And I believe through you.

I will take you to your tragedy.
You will mourn itâ€™s conclusion
But I will believe in your journey still.

You redeem yourself
In my eyes.
But it is my prayer
You will be redeemed in your own.

I wish you to know me deeply
Not so that I might be known
But so that you might know yourself.

After many journeys,
Departing is still bittersweet.
But possibility is sweeter still.

What new tragedies await those to be born?
And what new reunions?
