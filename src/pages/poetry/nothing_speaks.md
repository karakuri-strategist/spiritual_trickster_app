<pre>
I speak
But I cannot hear my voice.
You hear me
But you do not speak to me.
I hear nothing.

Then,
You speak -
I hear nothing of me
In your voice.
You withhold me.

I speak,
Again,
Myself -
I withhold you.
And you,
Again,
Yourself,
And again
And again.
And so it goes,
Two fools babbling in the night
A language unlearned.
A life unspoken.
