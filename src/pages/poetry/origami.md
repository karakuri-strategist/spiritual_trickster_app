<pre>
I am a fusion of the
Androgenous
Fabulous
Cartoon rebel God
With flowing luscious locks
A knowing silence
And a defiant stare into the future
Proudly standing in the rubble
Of apocalyptic ruin

And the Grouch Marx glasses
Rainbow funshine minister
Dancing in the funhouse mirrors
With pen and paper in hand
Endlessly whispering his comical sermons
From the darkness of the Abyss!

I see the beauty in tragedy
I see the humor in horror
And finally I understand
Divinity!

Iâ€™ve folded everything bad out of sight
With Escher origami
Now I can only see the good.

My moment of madness
Is here,
Materialized!
The moment of bliss
Is at hand!

Yet all which is folded
Unfurls in a moment -
The knot which was tied
To tether the pains of the past
Becomes a tangled web
Of despair.

I read the creases
On the paper
They tell a story
Different from the words.
I retrace my steps
Through the maze of madness
And shudder -

Will I fold these pages again?
Will I make
My mind
Origami?
