<pre>
To those who dodge their own reflection
Who skirt all gazes
Who would not see
With the eyes of another -

The light of your soul is scattered
Across many surfaces
A refraction through many lenses.
It will return to you
In your image of the world.
On all sides
You will be surrounded
Be it harsh or gentle
Blinding or illuminating.

You cannot avert your gaze
Even in blindness.
What has been seen
Cannot be unseen.
The light is dancing
Beneath your eyelids.
