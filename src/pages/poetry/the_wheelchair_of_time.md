<pre>
I am being pushed
In the wheelchair of time
Through meadows and valleys
By a gentle guide.
I,
A beloved object.
I,
A porcelain doll.
I,
A repetition
In a hall of mirrors.
I,
An illusion
Between illusions.

I cannot look
I can only see.
I cannot become
I can only be.
I can only remain.
I can never be free.
