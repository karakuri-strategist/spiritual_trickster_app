<pre>
My life is a secret
Boiling beneath the earth.
My form is a geyser
Erupting through the surface
Of appearance.
Honesty is a gushing well -
I release myself.
But the caverns
Which course below
Are wider than my mouth
Longer than my limbs.
I speak and sway
I set sensations
Swelling in my soul
Free.

But you will never witness
The river raging beneath.
The line which divides us
The lens peculiar to our person's.
I pierce from without.
I rise from within.
But I am the moment prior
I am before entry
Into you.
A refraction of a refraction
A whole in the part.
I am not there
At the end of the trail
Of a million words.
I am the journey
To the place you cannot go.

I have drilled deep into your image
And found only myself.
I wept at your absence
But the tears have dried.
You are where I am
And you are the "where"
That I am.
I feel you in between myself
And myself,
Between you.

This slow drip of a mystery
Which grows ever deeper.
This debt which cannot be repaid -
I arrive with my pittance
And give the teller a smile.
I demand compensation
But please,
Never make good
On your debts.
I only ask that you return
With less than nothing in hand.
Your debt is my payment -
That we are bound together
By beauty without equal
A currency beyond calculation.

Be free of me
But know that I am at the end
Of all roads
Which lead nowhere.
I am a lump of earth
You will stumble over me.
(Or I, you.)
Tell me about your journey
With all its twists and turns.
You can spare me the conclusion
I already know about
The destination.
