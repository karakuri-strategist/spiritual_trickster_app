<pre>
The one who loves justice
And loves the just.
The one who loves the sinner
Yet also loves the sin.

An awe inspiring and terrifying love
Which one cannot help but turn to
In their darkest hour.

Who,
For the price of their love,
Asks only that you bear your burden
Even as they load it upon you.
The one who assures you
You will have your story
Enchants with promises of wonder and glory
But fools you into acting out a small part
In another's play
Be it tragedy
Or comedy.

Theirs is not the only love.
The love of a world
Which dazzles
And confuses
Wounds
And heals
And wounds again.

Reach out to me
The one who wishes for you
A life you yourself would affirm.
I only ask that you return the favor.

Together,
We will fool Fate.
We will have our story.
We will trick
The Trickster.
