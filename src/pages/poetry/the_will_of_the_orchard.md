<pre>
My flesh
Crisp like an apple.
My will be done -
Dig into me
Consume me.
Carve me with you fangs.

And in so doing,
You will serve my kind.
You will spread and fertilize my seed.
Nurture me
And take from me.

But know that through this
You only give
You only serve.
Know that I adore your nature
You,
My natural partner,
The beast.
