<pre>
I want to get closer to the truth.
But the path forward
Is paved with blunders!
In order to walk forward
I have to look like a newborn
Always taking their first steps.

I struggle with rejection
Aren’t you a bit old to be stumbling?
I struggle with humiliation
Aww, baby hasn’t learned to walk?

That’s why
I’m thankful for a stern dismissal,
And I’m thankful for being laughed at.
When I’m wrong, I’m wrong!

I’m always getting over my embarrassment.
I’m learning to get back up
When I stumble.

I’m not willing to settle
For feeling right
Or appearing right
I have to know I’m getting closer.

Eventually people realize
They are losing life’s race
To a bumbling baby
And they try to catch up.

That’s when they realize
They all have baby legs!
They haven’t moved an inch.
(That’s when they usually
Shit themselves)

I’m not the first baby
And I won’t be the last
In the Great Baby Race
You can laugh,
Or you can try
To set a new record!

Just don’t soil your diaper
You have to change it yourself!
