Here’s a tip for cool guys and gals:
Don’t confuse tricks that make you elusive
For ones that get you closer to the truth.

The easiest way
To make an impenetrable mystery
Is to drop a marble
In a big empty room
In a sea of styrofoam
And turn off the lights.
What an enigma!

You got me good.
I spent so long trying to figure you out.
I’ll take your grain of truth,
And leave you with the rest.
Bye!
Thanks for the game,
Mr Dark and Mysterious!

Did you know
There is more than one marble in the world?
You’re supposed to collect them!

Looking cool is the art
Of making people waste their time on you!
Just don’t end up wasting time on yourself.

It’s better to have an empty house with two marbles
Then a house with one, and a million packing peanuts.
Instead of getting everyone to come to your home,
Why don’t you go to someone else’s for a while?

Now I think the coolest people
Are the ones who try to trade marbles
Without the fluff.
But some people always seem to bring their own!
Maybe to them I’m dark and mysterious.
Maybe it was no one’s fault?
Maybe I brought my own packing peanuts,
And turned off my own lights
When I was born.
Maybe babies come packaged
In darkness and mystery.

Everyone grab a flashlight
And start cleaning up,
We need to find the baby!

Where is little Mr Dark and Mysterious?
