<pre>
There is only one experience of beginning
Unless we allow ourselves to forget.
Unless we give freely of ourselves
What is most precious
Or it is taken.
The gift of the giver,
The gift of the thief.
Can you tell which is which?

When the book of the soul has been returned
The creases and stains of the pages
Tell a story of their own.
A story of many readers
A story of many authors
Whose tales we are always chasing.
