<pre>
The kingdom of kingdoms
The king of kings.
The worship of the worshiper
The chorus of choirs.
The love of love
The joy of joys.
The earth of earths
The ocean of oceans
The garden of gardens
The blossom of blossoms.

You do not see you
I do.
Look into the eye of eyes
Hear the song of songs
And know yourself.
