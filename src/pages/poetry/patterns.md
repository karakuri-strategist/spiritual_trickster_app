<pre>
You see a pattern -
But do you see the pattern in patterns?
That which cannot be seen with eyes
But in memory only.
And of those and of those,
In a dance of unity in tension?
Deception unto deception
A kaleidoscopic scheme of schemes
Ever deeper in an unfolding rose
Which never ceases to open.

This maelstrom of meaning
This torrent of tears
It cries -
Will you see me as I am?
