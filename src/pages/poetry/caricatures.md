<pre>
I used to think I was a caricature of a man.
Now I see I am a man
Who mistook himself for a caricature.
Now I can finally admit I like cartoons
I used to feel embarrassed.
And now I see the charm and tragedy
In the men who act like them.
It was only in my tragedy that I finally charmed myself.
Now I find everything charming!
