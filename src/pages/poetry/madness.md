<pre>
There is insight in madness
If you would take it.
The splendor of totality
Overwhelms you in ecstasy.
But beware -
The light may blind you
As wonder turns to terror
And they become one in horrible awe.
The whole unravels into pieces
As a broad gaze
Narrows to a pinhole
And vision turns to blindness.

In the darkness
The charred ashes of desperation
Keeps smoldering.
Knowledge flows from the abyss.
Step into the fire -
Be cleansed by the multitude 
Of flaming swords
Descending swiftly upon you.

See resentment
Devouring itself
Curling in its own mouth
Like Ouroboros.
Every piercing word
Set free
Every cruel fantasy
Re-enacted in the mind
Dancing in the meadow with the flowers
Swimming in the ocean currents
Soaring through the endless sky.
A dark beauty beyond fear
At the last sighing breath of sorrow.
Your dreams enveloped
By a world beyond you.

Blossoming from the sands of drought
A strength beyond all hope
A love beyond all appearances
The wisdom of the fallen
In the web of a complex world.
A dignity beyond life
A nothing which affirms itself
Which reaches out from emptiness
And wills itself to be.
Smoke rises in the curtain of night
From the candle of your soul.
This is the truth
Which resides at the center
Of the burning heart of madness.
So,
Would you take it?
