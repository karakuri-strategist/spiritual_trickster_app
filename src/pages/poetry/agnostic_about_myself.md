<pre>
The secret nightmare of every dark mystery
Is that it’s obscuring the simple or mundane
Or worse,
Nothing.

I’ve always suspected I was nothing!
So I tried to be honest
By playing the part
By hiding myself away.

Then I privately attempted
To prove that I was right.
But I kept pulling myself
Out of thin air.
How?

Now I am agnostic about myself.
Am I an empty sack
Full of tricks and trinkets
Or am I really a magic hat?
Does trying to pull the rabbit out
Make it appear?

Now I show people the mystery
I can’t figure out.
I tell them,
I don’t know myself -
Do you?
