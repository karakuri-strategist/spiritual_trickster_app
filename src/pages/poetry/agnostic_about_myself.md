<pre>
The secret nightmare of every dark mystery
Is that it’s obscuring the simple or mundane
Or worse,
Nothing.

I’ve always suspected I was nothing!
So I tried to be honest
By playing the part
By hiding myself away.

Then I privately attempted
To prove that I was right.
But I kept making something
Out of nothing.
How?

Now I am agnostic about myself.
Am I an empty sack
Full of trinkets and tricks
Or am I really a magic hat?
Does trying to pull the rabbit out
Make it appear?

Now I show people the mystery
I can’t wrap my head around.
I tell them,
I don’t know myself
Can you figure me out?
